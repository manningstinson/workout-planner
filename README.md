# Workout Planner
This is a low fidelity wireframe/prototype of a workout planner.  It is being designed to allow a user to submit an exercise, and retrieve exercises. Currently just black, and white it serves more as a guide to designers, and future developers of the project.  It is very simple on purpose.  

# File Structure
- **Routes:** Python files to retrieve and submit data.
- **Static:** Stylesheets, JS, and IMG directories
- **Templates:** HTML files

## How to use the Planner
The submit exercise page will allow a user to submit an exercise that will be added to a MySQL database. The Retrieve Exercise will eventually allow a user to retrieve several exercises based on a specific search criteria.

## Challenges
A small sample project was created approximately 2 months ago, and served as a basis for this hacksprint project.  Unfortunately, there were issues with deployment to digital ocean, and difficulty connecting to the database. Environment variables were initially setup to mask the database connection details, along with a .gitignore file.  We experienced issues with a Method not found error, when an entry got submitted to the database.  This was the first time working with an external provider, APP engine, and componenets.  

## Wiki
A wiki is being created to document the development process.  Currently empty, but will added to as the project progresses.
You can access the wiki here.
